====== Citations for DokuWiki ======

===== About =====

This plugin gives you the ability to let users cite your work. This is required quite often in academia and journalism.

The way this is done is by appending "&do=cite" to a wiki page's URL in addition to an optional revision number, for example "rev=123456789".

**Note:** Some templates may be "citation aware", but otherwise you will need to add code to your template's **main.php** for the citation links to appear!

===== Setup =====

In **main.php**, add the following at the top of the file:
<code php><?php if (file_exists(DOKU_PLUGIN.'cite/code.php')) include_once(DOKU_PLUGIN.'cite/code.php'); ?></code>

To display a permanent link or citation link at any point in your document, use the following code as an example:
<code php><?php if (function_exists('cite_getPermURL')) { ?><a href="<?php echo cite_getPermURL(); ?>" rel="nofollow">Permanent Link</a><?php } ?>
<?php if (function_exists('cite_getCiteURL')) { ?><a href="<?php echo cite_getCiteURL(); ?>" rel="nofollow">Cite this Page</a><?php } ?></code>

My advice is to keep the ''%%rel="nofollow"%%'' intact as this ensures search engines don't index citations.

Set the options for this plugin via the **Configuration Settings** menu from the DokuWiki admin menu. (It will be near the bottom of the page.)

===== For template developers =====

The plugin also exports two functions for use with your template:

  * **cite_getPermURL** : A //permanent link// to a page revision
  * **cite_getCiteURL** : A //citation link// so that you can let others easily cite your work

Please feel free to use those functions if you intend to make your template "citation aware".
